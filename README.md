Handwritten Digit Classification Using CNNs
This project demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classifying handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. The repository includes:

Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalization and reshaping of input images.
Model Architecture: A CNN model with two convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Training: Model trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
Evaluation: Performance metrics, including accuracy and loss plots for training and validation.
Visualization: Predicted labels compared with true labels on test images.
Tools and Technologies
Language: Python 3.10
Framework: TensorFlow 2.12.0
Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib
