Handwritten Digit Classification Using CNNs

This project is about using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset.

The dataset was preprocessed by normalizing and reshaping the images.
The model has two convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
It was trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.
The model achieved good accuracy and its predictions were visualized with test images.
